HOW TO PLAY
LEFT CLICK = Reveal tile
RIGHT CLICK = Flag or unflag tile
GOAL = Find all safe tiles without clicking a mine
First click is always safe
New Game button = restart

Tip: Do not open index.html directly. The game needs a server. And use CTRL + SHIFT + R for a hard refresh of the website if it does not show the Minesweeper.
